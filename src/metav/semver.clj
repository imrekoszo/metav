;;; An implementation of Semantic Version 2.0.0. (borrowed from [lein-v(https://github.com/roomkey/lein-v)])
;;; It supports major and minor releases and implicit patch releases based on the commit
;;; distance from the last major/minor version-tagged commit.  SCM tags are, however, of the
;;; form "major.minor.0" to be more aesthetically pleasing and consistent with the standard.
;;; SHA metadata is added for positive commit distances, and a "DIRTY" metadatum is added when
;;; appropriate.  There is no support for Semantic Version's pre-releases!  The ordering/
;;; precedence rules cannot be reconciled with the automatic assignment of patch releases.
